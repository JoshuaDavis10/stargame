- need to create an input state that keeps track of which keys/buttons
are currently down and where the mouse is

- I need to get window resizing figured out, maybe keep a 
consistent aspect ratio? + be able to full screen
	- get window resize event
	- manually resize window to preserve aspect ratio
	- simple window operations section (13) in xcb "tutorial"
	documentation for that 2nd thing
	- how to full screen?
