"GAME DESIGN" DOC for Shape War!

1 resource
3 buildings
- resource harvester (can be built anywhere)
- main building (kill this to win)
- barracks (produce troops)
3 unit types
- medium health melee unit - cheap, fast?
- low health, high damage range unit - cheap-ish, slow?
- high health melee unit, high damage - expensive, slow?

SQUARE for big unit
TRIANGLE for melee unit
X for ranged unit
DIAMOND for harvest building
HEXAGON for main building
CIRCLE for barracks (like 2x2 or smn)
 
blue vs red <- color of shape is which team it's on (obviously)

NOTE: ^ currently have functions to draw all of those

next up:
game state
	- nexus
		- health
		- position
	- *your_units
		- health
		- position
	- *your_buildings
		- health
		- position
		- progress (if applicable)
	- your current "money"
	- *enemy_units
		- health
		- position

game loop:
	- your units
		- if no target, check for enemies to acquire target
		- if target
			- if in range, and attack not on cooldown
			- else move toward target
		- else	
			- if target move position, move toward there
			- else do nothing
	- enemy units same thing
	- your buildings
		- update progress

			this can be reordered ofc just getting the gist down

so a nice "entity" struct
{
	i32 health;
	i32 x, y; <- position
	u32 progress; <- always 0 for anything other than barracks/harvester
						WAIT maybe this is how u track attack cooldowns?
}

TODO: get all of the above done
