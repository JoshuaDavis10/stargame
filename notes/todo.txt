so I can draw triangles with color interpolation onw
[ ] I think next step is to have a mesh construct with vertices that have position and color
so then have a funciton that draws a given mesh at a given position (draw_mesh) I guess

[ ] factor out draw_triangles into smaller functions that can be profiled separately/this will make the
code less chaos

[ ] build square tilemap (like small 8x8) and make a little game, maybe just chess?
	- a game this simple could also be a nice spot to put networking into the game engine 
	(but that's kind of a horrible idea right now since that's a lot of work and you need to program graphics fr)

[ ] might want to do a performance pass before going on to harder topics, since triangle rasterization needs
to be REALLY fast

[ ] texture mapping?
	- spend lots of time learning/researching before implementing

[ ] 3D?
	- spend lots of time learning/researching before implementing
