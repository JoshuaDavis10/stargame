so I can draw triangles with color interpolation onw and ~37 fps on 1920x1080
[x] I think next step is to have a mesh construct with vertices that have position and color
so then have a funciton that draws a given mesh at a given position (draw_mesh) I guess

[ ] build square tilemap (like small 8x8) and make a little game, maybe just chess?
	- can render a tilemap (8x8) @ 20 fps on 2560x1440 and ~37 fps on 1920x1080 and 60 fps on 1280x720
	[ ] triangle rendering is bugging if I try to render smn that isn't a right triangle
		- TODO: FIX THIS
	[x] add little guys that you can select and move to different tile
		- basically, you click a tile and a guy appears there
	[ ] okay, you did a lot of side quests, but now actually get ^ the above feature in
		- you click a tile with a guy, that guy gets selected
		- if you click an empty tile when you have a guy selected, the guy will go to that tile

[ ] might want to do a performance pass before going on to harder topics, since triangle rasterization needs
to be REALLY fast

[ ] texture mapping?
	- spend lots of time learning/researching before implementing

[ ] 3D?
	- spend lots of time learning/researching before implementing
