so I can draw triangles with color interpolation onw and ~37 fps on 1920x1080
[x] I think next step is to have a mesh construct with vertices that have position and color
so then have a funciton that draws a given mesh at a given position (draw_mesh) I guess

[x] build square tilemap (like small 8x8) and make a little game, maybe just chess?
	- can render a tilemap (8x8) @ 20 fps on 2560x1440 and ~37 fps on 1920x1080 and 60 fps on 1280x720

	[x] add little guys that you can select and move to different tile
		- basically, you click a tile and a guy appears there
	[x] okay, you did a lot of side quests, but now actually get ^ the above feature in
		- you click a tile with a guy, that guy gets selected
		- if you click an empty tile when you have a guy selected, the guy will go to that tile
	[x] built puzzle system already lol, forgot to update this
	[ ] add like color interpolation between tile changes (each tile keeps track of it's 'target' type, i.e. what it's gonna change to
	+ what it already is), so that it looks cool the tiles like change color slowly, ya know... gonna need like a draw_mesh_interpolated?
	and pass in the color you want to interpolate to + some normalized value that indicates how much to bias one way (that value is obv calculated
	from the elapsed time since the last step in the step through move process)
	[ ] next step is probably an editor so I can make puzzles quickly/also need to be able to load puzzles
	from files obv lol
		- play with the current tile behavior you have, and maybe be able to adjust unit behavior as well
		- basically, see if its any good and make some puzzles with it
	************************************************************************************
	[ ] triangle rendering is bugging if I try to render smn that isn't a right triangle
		- TODO: FIX THIS
	************************************************************************************
	[ ] get triangle rendering fixed so you can make different meshes for the different units
		- if you feel like it's worth working on graphics more
	[ ] really need to boost renderer's performance, maybe with SIMD on triangle rasterization or smn
	

[ ] might want to do a performance pass before going on to harder topics, since triangle rasterization needs
to be REALLY fast

[ ] texture mapping?
	- spend lots of time learning/researching before implementing

[ ] 3D?
	- spend lots of time learning/researching before implementing
