THIS FILE IS FOR ME ONLY SO ANYONE THAT THINKS THIS IS A SCUFFED TICKETING SYSTEM... WELL IT WORKS SO GET OVER IT

(x, y, z)

x: ticket is on this project
y: id of ticket (based on project, i.e. project 1 and 2, both have a ticket with ID 0)
z: ticket depends on this other ticket


TICKETS:
[x] (1, 0, -) -> remove tilemap_access function and just map tilemap memory directly to a struct, with counter, width/height, tile data for easy access
[x] (1, 1, 0) -> refactor input handling
[x] (1, 2, 0) -> FEATURE: adjustable Red, Blue, Green unit counters in editor (i.e. editor can change how many RGB units can be placed for the level being edited)
[x] (1, 3, 0) -> FEATURE: adjust size of editor's tiles based on width/height of tilemap
[x] (1, 7, 0) -> if editor is passed nonexistent file, just create a new level with width 1, height 1 or smn
[ ] (1, 4, -) -> BUGFIX: allow tilegame to reload levels that have just been edited by editor without breaking
				 - reallocate memory when reloading a tilemap (tilemap memory must be @ end of game_memory, so it can be freed, reallocated)
				 - make sure rendered tile size is adjusted after reload and is based on MAX(width, height) rather than width every time. that way any level can fit on screen correctly
[ ] (1, 5, -) -> FEATURE: tilegame unit placements that cause other units to change, should sort of "recursively" cause those changed units to change their tile, resulting in compounding effects
				 - must be able to handle case where a tile would be changed by 2 tiles and/or units at once, i.e. what is order of operations
[ ] (1, 6, ALL OTHER PROJECT 1 TICKETS REQUIRED) -> design 10 tutorial/demo/intro levels to hand out as a playtest to friends. obv the game will need to like load them in order, loading lvl one at startup..

[ ] (2, 0, -) -> IN PROGRESS: windows platform layer
[x] (2, 1, -) -> win32_util.c

[ ] (3, 0, -) -> UI code
				 - menus, buttons, stuff you'll need for UI. KEEP VERY SIMPLE
[ ] (3, 1, 0) -> UI for game
				 - refactor existing UI code or just delete it (prob delete LOL)
				 - level select, fade out of levels when win and go back to level select
				 - clear instructions on how to play
[ ] (3, 2, 0) -> UI for editor (honestly totally optional for completing a demo bc only you are using editor it can be as scuffed as u want as long as it works)

PROJECTS:
1 Editor + 10 intro/tutorial/demo levels
2 Windows Port
3 UI
