# stargame

## software rendered game engine

### build with compile.bash (./compile.bash 0 if you don't want profiler data to print at runtime, ./compile.bash 1 if
### you do)

### run ./tilegame.bash or ./editor.bash to run tilegame or editor, respectively.

### if you want to use a diff C compiler or build things differently in some way, just use the compile.bash file as a
### reference
